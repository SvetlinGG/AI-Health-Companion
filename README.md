🩺 What AI Health Companion Does and How to Use It

AI Health Companion is a conversational web application that helps users ask health-related or lifestyle questions and receive accurate, cited answers generated by Google’s Gemini AI model.
It connects to verified medical data sources through a custom Fivetran data connector and organizes all interactions and insights inside Google BigQuery for analysis and improvement.

Users can:

1. Open the app in their browser (desktop or mobile).

2. Type a question such as “What are early signs of vitamin D deficiency?”

3. Get an instant, Gemini-powered answer with references to reliable sources.

4. View trends and insights on the dashboard (top topics, daily activity).

Everything runs securely in the cloud — no personal health data is stored, only anonymized usage for analytics and better recommendations.

> **An AI-powered health assistant** that combines Google Cloud Vertex AI (Gemini) with Fivetran and BigQuery to deliver intelligent, cited health insights and data-driven analytics.

## 🌟 Inspiration
Our team wanted to build something truly helpful in everyday life — a **trusted AI companion for health-related questions**, powered by **real data**, not just language models.  
We noticed that people often turn to the internet for health advice but rarely get answers backed by reliable information.  
That inspired us to combine **Google Cloud’s Vertex AI (Gemini)** with **Fivetran’s automated data pipelines** and **BigQuery analytics**, to deliver not only answers, but also insights.

## 💡 What it does
**AI Health Companion** is a conversational assistant that:

- Lets users ask **health or lifestyle questions** in natural language.  
- Generates **accurate, cited answers** using Gemini on Vertex AI.  
- Stores **anonymized interaction data** in BigQuery via a custom Fivetran Connector.  
- Visualizes **daily usage and top health topics** in an Angular dashboard.  
- Continuously ingests **new verified health content daily** through an agentic workflow using Vertex AI summarization.

## 🏗️ How we built it

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 18 (standalone components, Signals, Data Viz) → deployed on Netlify.  
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express on Cloud Run → handles `/api/ask`, `/etl`, `/analytics/snapshot`.  
- **Connector:** Custom Python service (FastAPI) built with Fivetran Connector SDK, deployed to Cloud Run.  
- **Data Layer:** Fivetran → BigQuery dataset (`ai_health`) → views for analytics.  
- **AI Layer:** Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for real-time Q&A, summarization, and auto-tagging of new content.  
- **Automation:** Cloud Scheduler triggers a daily ingest job → Gemini annotates articles → Fivetran syncs data into BigQuery.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions deploys backend & connector to Cloud Run, and frontend to Netlify.

## ⚙️ Challenges we ran into
- Setting up the **Fivetran custom connector** with correct pagination and schema discovery logic.  
- Handling **Vertex AI authentication** on Cloud Run without exposing keys (service accounts).  
- Ensuring **CORS and proxy rules** worked seamlessly between Netlify and Cloud Run.  
- Managing **schema consistency in BigQuery** when syncing incremental data.  
- Designing a **lightweight yet meaningful analytics dashboard**.

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Built a fully working **end-to-end AI data pipeline** in under two weeks.  
- Integrated **Fivetran → BigQuery → Vertex AI** smoothly for continuous data enrichment.  
- Created a clean **Angular UI** with real-time insights (usage trends, feedback, sources).  
- Deployed everything **serverlessly** using **Cloud Run** and **Netlify**.  
- Implemented an **agentic ingestion flow** for daily health article annotation using Gemini.

## 📚 What we learned
- How to design **LLM-driven apps** that combine conversational AI with structured analytics.  
- The power of **Fivetran SDK** for building custom data connectors.  
- Best practices for **secure AI deployments** using Secret Manager & IAM roles.  
- Efficient **CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions → Cloud Run → Netlify.  
- Collaboration and iteration in a multi-service cloud environment.

## 🚀 What's next
- Expand the **knowledge base** with verified medical sources.  
- Implement **personalized dashboards** and recommendation insights.  
- Add **multi-language support** (EN/BG/DE).  
- Integrate **Elastic hybrid search** for context-grounded answers.  
- Build a **mobile app** for offline Q&A and notifications.
